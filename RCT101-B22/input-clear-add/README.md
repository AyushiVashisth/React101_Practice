## ## REACT - INPUT BOX

## Problem

create an input box

maintain a state called text

when a user types in, update the state, with the onChange event

retrieve the value from the event.target

update the state by using setText ( Reacts dispatcher for updating the value )

show the text in a h2 tag below the input box

add a button called CLEAR, when you click on it, it should clear the text for the user on both the input box and the UI
