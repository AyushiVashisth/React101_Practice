## ##COUNTER
## Problem

create a component called Counter

use React.useState hook

give it a default value of 0 React.useState(0)

destructure from useState by using [ count, setCount ]

display the information in an h1 tag <h1> Count is {count} </h1>

create a button with an event listener and attach handleClick function to it

the handleFunction should be able to update count by setCount(count+1)
