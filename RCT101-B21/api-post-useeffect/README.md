# # REACT - USEEFFECT - I - GET TODO

# Problem

## create a simple todo app

-> Use mock server to retrieve todo list when the component mounts

-> there should be loading and error states managed and shown to the UI( mandatory )

-> build a pagination component that will change the page and fetch data for you

## Bonus:

-> use the pagination links from the headers response in json mock server, read more

-> use parse-link-headers npm package ( npm install package name )
